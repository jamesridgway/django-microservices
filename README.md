# Django Microservices
This is a basic and crude project that is design to illustrate some of the concepts behind microservices.

# Microservices
This project contains two microservices:

* Store - an online store where customers place orders
* Warehouse - a warehouse system where the warehouse team can manage orders that have been placed.
